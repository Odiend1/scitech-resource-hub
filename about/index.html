        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Hello <span class="accent"><b>DRAGONS</b></span>, and Welcome to Science Academy. We are known as the “nerdy school” of the STISD (South Texas Independent District), and we are PROUD of it. Here at Science Academy, every student can shine and be themselves, no matter how quirky, weird, or awesome they may be. Our main quote is “Keep Sci-Tech Weird,” and trust me, we do. Science Academy, is a magnet high-school located in Mercedes, Texas, in the STISD district. At science academy students can take a variety of different classes from science, history, english, and math. However, we do offer a variety of electives relating to both engineering and computer science, in order to expand the students' knowledge in different fields. Students can choose to take either honors level classes, AP classes, or dual credit/enrollment classes. However, our classes aren’t the only thing that makes our school special, it’s also our community! </p>
        <p>Here at Science Academy, we have a very diverse community from people all over the RGV. Due to this, students make a variety of different connections and meet people from different areas contributing to new connections all around!</p>
